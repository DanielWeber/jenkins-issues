= [Solved] Memory leak with Pipelines

Problem solved with https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Groovy+Plugin[Pipeline Groovy Plugin] version 2.23.
Also see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/mzPx8qFrNcM/QVJ5Qk9xAwAJ[Jenkins-dev].

== What happens?

We run into memory issues on our Jenkins master, it needs to be restarted after at most a week. We make intensive use of pipelines.

At first, the easy way out was to increase the heap available to our master, meanwhile we've reached `-Xmx48g`.
Last week it only "survived" 3 days. There are about 60 agents (2 executors each) handling more than 1200 pipeline jobs.

== Analysis

Our Jenkins master is running on Windows Server 2012, using a 64Bit Oracle JVM (1.8.0_112).

These are the plugins we're running on our test instance (Jenkins 2.19.1):

The problems seems to be that Groovy classes are not GCed. The number of classes loaded keeps increasing
as does the amount of heap used. You can see the amount of heap not being freed is steadily increasing:

image::images\README-08f6e.png[]

The histogram shows a large number of Groovy related objects (about 30000 classes were loaded at the time):

  num     #instances         #bytes  class name

   ...

We can reproduce this with a minimal pipeline script, see next section.

== Reproducing the Issue

I set up a repository with some files I used to reproduce this issue. Here's how:

. Prepare a Jenkins master with the latest pipeline plugins, JobDSL, CloudBees folders installed (see above for the full list I used)
. Make sure you have 1 or more slaves that can handle the load
. Create a new pipeline job, running `pipeline-memory-leak/Jenkinsfile`. It needs to define a boolean parameter `enableTrigger`
. Run it
. It will generate 200 test jobs which run once a minute.

As the test pipelines are executed, you can see the number of classes growing, as well as heap usage.

When running the Jenkins master with -Xmx3g, it does not take long for it to become unresponsive.

After about 6 minutes, my test instance already grew from about 12k classes to 22k:

image::images\README-6f73f.png[]

And reached 30k after about 15 minutes:

image::images\README-8fe27.png[]

Garbage collection happens, but Groovy classes are not being unloaded.

While there's still some free heap space now, this will run into a garbage collector loop at some point.

We've reached a "flat line" after a little more than 1 hour, the Jenkins master is dead now:

== What we tried

* [x] Updated all plugins to their latest version. Did not help
* [x] Set -Dgroovy.use.classvalue=true, as reported in JENKINS-33358. Did not help. Double-checked ;). It really does not help.
* [x] Limit the size of Metaspace (-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=200000000). Did not help. It forced unloading of classes when reaching the limit. At that point Jenkins became unusable (no response, no more builds scheduled)
* [x] Updated to latest Java Version: 1.8.0_112. Did not help
* [x] Added -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled (kind of a desperate move...). Did not help
